This project was created for a client who runs a business specializing in rafting trips and excursions. I coded it using basic HTML and CSS without any JavaScript involved.<br>
<br>
The website consists of 3 main webpages:<br>
<b>Home</b>: This page features cards with tips to clean and optimize a PC. It includes 8 cards, each representing a different tip. A brief description with instruction these cards. Also, it display a carousel of images.<br>
<b>FAQ</b>: This section addresses common questions from website visitors. It's designed with 3 cards containing informative text, aligned using a grid layout for neatness.<br>
<b>About us</b>: It shows a brief description about the company and the physical location.<br>

The website highlights my ability to plan, document, and design websites before diving into coding.<br>
I prepared various aspects of the site:
<ul>
    <li>Purpose and Audience: Understanding the website's goals and target audience.</li>
    <li>Branding: Incorporating logos and design elements.</li>
    <li>Style Guide: Defining a color palette and typography, illustrated with examples.</li>
    <li>Site Map: Organizing the website's structure.</li>
    <li>Content: Organizing and displaying website's content</li>
    <li>Wireframe: Creating mockup designs to visualize the site's layout.  </li>
</ul>

This website represents where I started my web design foundation, as it was one of my first projects. It shows that, at that time, I had a basic understanding of ethical guidelines and procedures.<br>
The website demonstrates my capacity for planning, organizing content, efficient HTML element usage, and the application of consistent, well-structured design principles using CSS.
