      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal is to develop my company and acquire more customers.
        I require this website in order to help people and increase my client base and my potential market.
        First, I want to expand my business locally and start marketing my website to my genuine clientele. By doing this, I will have a strong base of customers in my state.
        Second, I need to start contacting potential clients outside of my state in order to build my business.
        My business will gain from having a wider audience and more customers.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My ideal clients are those who are curious about how to fix and maintain basic issues with their PCs. If they encounter more complicated issues, they can find my contact information and bring their PC to me.
        My website will focus on customers who fall into the 16 to 23 age range and have the means to purchase a PC.
        They want to learn quick fixes for PC issues or quick tricks to speed up their computer; if they have more complex issues, they will bring the computer to me.
        Advanced troubleshooting, individualized customer service, and hardware tips are needs that are not being met.
