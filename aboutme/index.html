            Hi everyone! Nate here... I'm really excited for this new semester and to learn with you all :D

        <p>
            I'm from Rosario, Argentina and I'm 21 years old, I've been member of the Church for all of my life and I returned from my mission 1 year ago. I served in Asuncion, Paraguay.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently working as a Insurance Agent for a US Company and studying to be a Software Developer</p>
        <p>
            My favorite hobbie is to play soccer with friends (I'm a goalkeeper). I love soccer and I'm really excited for the World Cup in a few months haha
        </p>
        <p>I wish everyone best of luck in this semester and the next ones!</p>
