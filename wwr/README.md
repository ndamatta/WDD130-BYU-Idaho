This project was created for a client who runs a business specializing in rafting trips and excursions. I coded it using basic HTML and CSS without any JavaScript involved.<br>
<br>
The website consists of 3 main webpages:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Home</b>: This page features captivating images showcasing the thrilling rafting activities available through the trips. It includes 3 cards, each representing a different kind of adventure. A brief description accompanies these cards, along with a call to action button to encourage visitors to join the business.</li>
    <li><b>FAQ</b>: This section addresses common questions from website visitors. It's designed with 6 cards containing informative text, aligned using a grid layout for neatness.</li>
    <li>Contact us</b>: This page wasn't coded as the client didn't provide specific details (not necessary for the project).</li>
</ul>

The website highlights my ability to plan, document, and design websites before diving into coding.<br>
I prepared various aspects of the site:
<ul>
    <li><b>Purpose and Audience</b>: Understanding the website's goals and target audience.</li>
    <li><b>Branding</b>: Incorporating logos and design elements.</li>
    <li><b>Style Guide</b>: Defining a color palette and typography, illustrated with examples.</li>
    <li><b>Site Map</b>: Organizing the website's structure.</li>
    <li><b>Wireframe</b>: Creating mockup designs to visualize the site's layout.  </li>
</ul>

This website represents where I started my web design foundation, as it was one of my first projects. It shows that I have a basic understanding of ethical guidelines and procedures.<br>
The website demonstrates my capacity for planning, organizing content, efficient HTML element usage, and the application of consistent, well-structured design principles using CSS.
