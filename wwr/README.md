This  program generates random sentences by combining determiners, nouns, verbs, prepositions, and prepositional phrases.<br>
The sentences are constructed based on different tenses and quantities of nouns to create varied and unique outputs.<br>
Also I coded programs to verify the correctness of both programs. The program utilizes the pytest testing framework to automatically execute the testing functions and validate the functionality of the prefix and suffix extraction.
